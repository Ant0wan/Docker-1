- `01` get the IP address of the "Char" virtual machine (host).

- `02` set the Docker environment variables related to the "Char" docker-machine deamon (host).

- `03` pull hello-world container image from offical repository.

- `04` try out docker running a hello-world container.

- `05` run an nginx container in background, named "overlord", restarting on its own, with port 80 attached to the port 5000 the "Char" host.

- `06` get the internal IP address of the overlord container.

- `07` launch sh in an Apline container.

- `08` setup a debian container with build-essentials.

- `09` create a volume named "hatchery".

- `10` list volumes.

- `11` run a mysql container in background named "spawning-pool", restarting on its own in case of error, with mysql root password "Kerrigan" and stored in the hatchery volume in a database named zerglings.

- `12` display environment variables the "spawning-pool".

- `13` run a wordpress container in background, named "lair", with port 80 bound to host port 8080, using the "spawning-pool" container database.

- `14` run a phpmyadmin container in background, named "roach-warden", with port 80 bound to port 8081 of the host bound to the "spawning-pool" database.

- `15` get "spawning-pool" containerâ€™s logs in real time.

- `16` display the "Char" host's currently active containers.

- `17` restart "overlord" container.

- `18` run flask container named "Abathur" with container/host ports 3000 bound.

- `19` create a local swarm on the "Char" host.

- `20` create a host using VirtualBox driver and named "Aiur".

- `21` set "Aiur" as slave of the local "Char" host leader's swarm.

- `22` create an overlay-type internal network named "overmind".

- `23` start a rabbitmq service named "orbital-command" with set user and set password, and working ont the "overmind" network.

- `24` list all local swarm services.

- `25` run a 42school/engineering-bay service in 2 replicas, named "engineering-bay" on the "overmind" network.

- `26`
